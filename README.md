# üìä Consumer Goods Sales Data Analysis (Excel Project)

üìå ## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing consumer goods sales performance data using **Excel only**.
The work involved cleaning and preparing the dataset, exploring it through pivot tables, and building an interactive dashboard to summarize the findings.

The analysis aims to answer key business questions such as:
* Which products and categories perform best?
* Who are the top customers and regions?
* How do shipping methods and returns affect sales?

üìÇ ## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of multiple sheets:
* **Orders**: The main fact table containing product details, sales, discounts, costs, and profits.
* **People**: Sales representatives and their assigned regions.
* **Return**: Information on returned orders.
* **Shipping Cost**: Shipping cost per unit for different states.

Additional sheets created during the project:
* **Pivot Calculation**: Used for exploratory analysis and answering specific business questions.
* **Dashboards**: Final interactive dashboard with KPIs, charts, and slicers.

‚öôÔ∏è ## Methodology
The project followed these main steps:
1.  **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Using Excel Power Query to remove errors, standardize fields, and prepare the dataset.
2.  **Data Modeling**: Creating relationships across multiple sheets using Power Pivot.
3.  **Exploratory Analysis**: Pivot tables and charts to answer detailed business questions.
4.  **Final Dashboard**: Building an interactive dashboard with KPIs, slicers, and charts.

üîç ## Exploratory Analysis (Pivot Calculation)
A set of pivot tables and charts were built to answer specific business questions, including:
* What is the most used ship mode by customers?
* Who are the top 10 customers by sales and by order frequency?
* Which client segment generates the most sales by category?
* Which city and state generate the most sales value?
* What percentage of sales value is contributed by each region?
* On average, how long does it take for orders to reach customers?

üìä ## Final Dashboard
The interactive dashboard focused on sales performance and included:
* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Total Sales, Orders, and Profit.
* **Sales Breakdown**: Sales by Category, Sub-Category, Cities, and States.
* **Performance Metrics**: Sales by Person & Region, and Top 10 Sales by States & Category.
* **Time Trends**: Sales Quantity by Years.
* **Interactivity**: Slicers for dynamic filtering.

üí° ## Key Insights
The analysis revealed several critical insights:
* Sales vary significantly across categories, with certain sub-categories dominating revenue.
* Regional performance shows strong contributions from specific territories.
* A small set of customers contributes disproportionately to overall sales (Top 10 customers).
* Shipping methods and returns have a measurable impact on profit margins.
* Sales trends over years indicate growth patterns and areas needing improvement.
